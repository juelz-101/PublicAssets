The music should draw from popular, upbeat UK genres such as hip-hop, drill, drum and bass, trap, dubstep, UK garage, trance, house, bassline, dancehall, and reggae. Avoid full singing or rapping, but incorporate vocal effects, DJ drops, radio speech snippets, and occasional short vocal samples to add character. The setting is 'Joolz-FM 101.1,' a fictional UK pirate radio station broadcasting from a London tower block. Periodically include retro-style UK pirate radio ads (inspired by classic Force FM spots), and sprinkle in comedic GTA-style radio events-like fake caller segments, competitions, or over-the-top news headlines-to create an immersive, authentic pirate radio vibe..",
