        <h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
        <h3>Interview with Emma MT</h3>
        <h4>Here is a transcript of an interview with the artist and our in-house journalist Codie:</h4>
        
        <p>[Codie]: Hello Emma MT, let's begin by talking about your first release "Dancing in the Sunlight", can you tell us what it is about?</p>
        <p>[Emma MT]: Hi Codie. On the surface the song is about, well dancing in the sunlight, but it has a much deeper meaning for those who listen closely.</p>
        <p>[Codie]: Sounds interesting, can you give us an insight to the production of the track?</p>
        <p>[Emma MT]: Well as a DNB raver, I always want to stick to my routes, but I wanted to evolved from beat focused conventional DNB and shift towards a more story driven style. After brainstorming with Juelz-101, we decided on a new album called "Brutalistening", which will be story driven and have a more atmospheric feel. This is the first song that we have made for the album.</p>
        <p>[Codie]: That sounds like a very exciting project. Is there any risk involved with releasing such an unconventional album?</p>
        <p>[Emma MT]: Risk? From a corperate standpoint, of course. This album wouldn't see the light of day. We are artists, with a passion for the art that we make. We have no concerns with profits or statistics, if I can speak to 1 listener then I have succeeded, which I have already achived because this album speaks to me on a deep level.</p>
        <p>[Codie]: In regards to the album, can we get a sneak-peak of what else is to come?</p>
        <p>[Emma MT]: Well I don't want to say too much, but just last week Juelz and I were brainstorming lyrics for a song for the album called "Concrete Heart" and it almost brought me to tears. We begin recording on Monday and I am so excited for this one.</p>
        <p>[Codie]: I look forward to checking in once that song is complete.</p>
