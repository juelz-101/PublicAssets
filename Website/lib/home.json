Wasn't it weird how our mums would see it happen and come running over in a blind rage with absolutely no context, only to clip the other ear because \"you clearly deserved it\".. That was the last time I ever said the Lollypop Lady looks like a banana in witness protection.",

He is even starting to get our accent, I love the awkward silence when he notices that he completely dropped his cool gangster accent in exchange for the classic British \"Cashier number 3 please\" accent. Tumbleweed, I hear you ask? Please, use mine.",

So here's a photo from his wedding, and a photo taken exactly 1 year and 0 seconds after he took a photo of his beer in his garden.",
