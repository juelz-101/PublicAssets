				"speaker": "Codie",
				"dialogue": "Hello Emma MT, let's begin by talking about your first release \"Dancing in the Sunlight\", can you tell us what it is about?"
			},
			{
				"speaker": "Emma MT",
				"dialogue": "Hi Codie. On the surface the song is about, well dancing in the sunlight, but it has a much deeper meaning for those who listen closely."
			},
			{
				"speaker": "Codie",
				"dialogue": "Sounds interesting, can you give us an insight to the production of the track?"
			},
			{
				"speaker": "Emma MT",
				"dialogue": "Well as a DNB raver, I always want to stick to my routes, but I wanted to evolved from beat focused conventional DNB and shift towards a more story driven style. After brainstorming with Juelz-101, we decided on a new album called \"Brutalistening\", which will be story driven and have a more atmospheric feel. This is the first song that we have made for the album."
			},
			{
				"speaker": "Codie",
				"dialogue": "That sounds like a very exciting project. Is there any risk involved with releasing such an unconventional album?"
			},
			{
				"speaker": "Emma MT",
				"dialogue": "Risk? From a corperate standpoint, of course. This album wouldn't see the light of day. We are artists, with a passion for the art that we make. We have no concerns with profits or statistics, if I can speak to 1 listener then I have succeeded, which I have already achived because this album speaks to me on a deep level."
			},
			{
				"speaker": "Codie",
				"dialogue": "In regards to the album, can we get a sneak-peak of what else is to come?"
			},
			{
				"speaker": "Emma MT",
				"dialogue": "Well I don't want to say too much, but just last week Juelz and I were brainstorming lyrics for a song for the album called \"Concrete Heart\" and it almost brought me to tears. We begin recording on Monday and I am so excited for this one."
			},
			{
				"speaker": "Codie",
				"dialogue": "I look forward to checking in once that song is complete."
