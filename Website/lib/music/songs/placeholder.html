        <div class="lyrics">
            <p class="intro">[Intro]:<br>Lazy days, we cruisin' in the summer haze<br>Windows down, we let the music blaze<br>City sounds mix with that beat we praise<br>In this urban jungle, we drift and laze</p>

            <p class="chorus">[Chorus]:<br>Feel the heat and the vibe, yeah, we're good<br>Blunt in hand, summer nights in the neighborhood</p>

            <p class="verse">[Verse]:<br>Streetlights flicker, painting golden trails<br>Laughter echoes, telling our own urban tales<br>Sidewalks warm beneath our wandering feet<br>In this concrete paradise, the world's so sweet</p>

            <p class="chorus">[Chorus]:<br>Feel the heat and the vibe, yeah, we're good<br>Blunt in hand, summer nights in the neighborhood</p>

            <p class="bridge">[Bridge]:<br>Feel the rhythm of the streets as they hum<br>Every corner's got a story, come and get some<br>Evening breezes carry whispers of fun<br>In this urban playground, we're all feeling young</p>

            <p class="chorus">[Chorus]:<br>Feel the heat and the vibe, yeah, we're good<br>Blunt in hand, summer nights in the neighborhood</p>

            <p class="bridge">[Bridge]:<br>In my mind, there's a place beyond the screens<br>Where stories lived in heartbeats, not in machines<br>Oh, I drift back to those days, simple and serene<br>Where laughter carried notes pristine</p>

            <p class="chorus">[Chorus]:<br>Longing for that time, where time moved slow<br>Before the pixels ruled and hearts would glow</p>

            <p class="verse">[Verse]:<br>In memories (memories), where laughter filled the air<br>We'd meet by the corner, under the streetlights' glare<br>Songs on the radio, stories we would share<br>Ah, those days, so vivid and rare</p>

            <p class="chorus">[Chorus]:<br>Take me back to those times, when life was free<br>No digital divides, just you and me<br>Rhythms flowed through hearts, simple and true<br>Moments sweet, in colors of every hue<br>The world now hides behind the screens' harsh glow<br>But I treasure moments where dreams would grow</p>

            <p class="verse">[Verse]:<br>In memories (memories), where laughter filled the air<br>We'd meet by the corner, under the streetlights' glare<br>Songs on the radio, stories we would share<br>Ah, those days, so vivid and rare</p>

            <p class="outro">[Outro]:<br>Gone are those days, but they live in our hearts<br>Her voice a reminder, as softly it departs</p>

        <h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
        <h3>Conversation Between Codie and Kyle's Mum</h3>
        
        <p>[Codie]: Hi there! I wasn’t expecting to run into you here. Congratulations on the release of "Summer Nights." I was listening to it and I can definetely relate to the lyrics.</p>

        <p>[Kyle's Mum]: Oh, hi Codie! Thank you so much. Honestly, it’s been a whirlwind. I never thought that little old me would ever be making her own music.</p>

        <p>[Codie]: What inspired you to write it? It really captures that laid-back, summer-evening feeling.</p>

        <p>[Kyle's Mum]: It started as a bit of nostalgia. I was reminiscing with an old friend about those long summer nights when we were younger—sneaking out, laughing until dawn, the whole carefree vibe. I was thinking about the discussion on the drive home, and I was sitting in traffic, in my own world, and ended up coming up with the "Oh, I drift back to those days, simple and serene
Where laughter carried notes pristine" part in my head. This was years ago, it has always stuck with me, over time it evolved into the bridge and chorus. It was only, what, two weeks ago  when I actually wrote it down and filled in the gaps to make it into a full song.</p>

        <p>[Codie]: You definitely succeeded. The lyrics are so vivid. I have to ask, was the "concrete paradise" based on a real place?</p>

        <p>[Kyle's Mum]: Absolutely! It’s a nod to the estate where I grew up. It wasn’t glamorous, but it was ours, you know? Summer nights there were magic—playing music, telling stories, just being together. That’s the “paradise” part, despite all the concrete.</p>

        <p>[Codie]: That’s beautiful. And your voice really carries the emotion. Did you always plan to sing it yourself?</p>

        <p>[Kyle's Mum]: Oh, not at all! I was hesitant at first. It was my producer who convinced me. He said the song felt too personal to hand over to someone else, and looking back, he was right.</p>

        <p>[Codie]: I’m glad he did! One more thing—how does it feel having your very own song?</p>

        <p>[Kyle's Mum]: It’s surreal! I hear snippets of it in my head when I’m dropping the kids off or picking them up. Their little faces light up as they run out of the gates ready to explore the world. I remember when that was me, it doesn't feel that long ago. It is just crazy how much life has changed since I was a kid, all of the stuff we used to do, all of the places we'd explore. I just want my boy to have the same experiences we had, the long life lessons learned  through being out there testing the boundaries of what it is to be a kid with the world at the palm of their hands. The flight or fight instinct practiced through more than running from a polygon figure of Slenderman in roblox on an I-Pad, if my Mum knew the stuff that we used to get up to when I was a kid, there wouldn't be no "Kyles Mum From the School Gates", there would only be "Kyles Mum from her Bedroom with no Tea" because shes still grounded. I would't change it for the world though, it prepared us for what life is really like outside of the fairy tales we'd see on TV. Some of the greatest memories that hold so close to my heart are from them times.</p>

        <p>[Codie]: That’s a great way to look at it. Thanks for chatting, and best of luck with your next project!</p>

        <p>[Kyle's Mum]: Thank you, Codie. I’d better get a move on, or my little one will think I’ve abandoned him. Take care!</p>
