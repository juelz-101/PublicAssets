        <h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
        <h3>Interview with Imperial-P</h3>
        <p>Here is a transcript of an interview with the artist and our in-house journalist Codie:</p>
        <p>[Codie]: </p>
        <p>[Imperial-P]: </p>
        <p>[Codie]: Hi Imperial-P, I'd like to begin this interview by talking about your latest track "The Silent Streets", what is the story behind the track?</p>
        <p>[Imperial-P]: Hey Codie, ok well the track was Juelz's idea, he approached me and asked if I'd rap in a song in memory of his brother. It'd be disrespectful to refuse.</p>
        <p>[Codie]: Did you know his brother?</p>
        <p>[Imperial-P]: I knew of him, everyone did, he was a legend around our way. One time I was on the bus and Danny, Juelz's brother was on there with a few of his pals. It was hilarious but it's probably not a good idea to mention what happened here.</p>
        <p>[Codie]: The song mentions the gang called IPM, are you a member?</p>
        <p>[Imperial-P]: Look, Juelz will tell you this, this song is in memory of Ziky and the gang he built, and had to leave behind back in the day. Neither of us have had any association with gangs since we were kids. This song is a nod to the old days. The style and vibe of the song reflect that.</p>
        <p>[Codie]: You were born in America, right? How was it rapping over english grime?</p>
        <p>[Imperial-P]: Yeah, I moved to London when I was 10 back in 2002, so grime is nothing new to me, it was quite nostalgic. We trialed a few beats for this track, they started really old school grimey, but in the end we went with a more bass heavy hip-hop style beat.</p>
