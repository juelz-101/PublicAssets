	"description": "Brutalistening is a dark, atmospheric journey into the depths of drum and bass, crafted by the visionary Emma MT and produced by Juelz-101. Inspired by the stark architecture and haunting isolation of an abandoned brutalist city—loosely based on London’s iconic Thamesmead estate—this album tells the gripping story of a 26-year-old woman struggling to survive in a concrete labyrinth. With only her loyal dog for companionship and hungry wolves lurking in the shadows, the music evokes a visceral sense of tension, resilience, and eerie beauty. Each track is a sonic exploration of desolation and determination, delivering hard-hitting beats that echo through the skeletal remains of urban decay. This is D&B at its most raw and cinematic—an unforgettable experience for those who dare to listen.",
