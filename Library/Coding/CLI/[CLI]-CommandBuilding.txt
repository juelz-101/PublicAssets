## Basic command layout

Most command-line tools (Windows, macOS, Linux, Python tools like `pip`) follow the same rough pattern:

```text
program [subcommand] [options] [arguments]
```

- **program**: The executable you run, e.g. `pip`, `git`, `python`.  
- **subcommand**: A specific action, e.g. `install`, `uninstall`, `commit`, `run`.  
- **options/flags**: Usually start with `-` or `--`, modify how the command behaves, e.g. `-r`, `--upgrade`, `--help`.  
- **arguments**: The “things” the command acts on, e.g. package names, file paths, URLs.

`pip install requests` is therefore:

- `pip` → program  
- `install` → subcommand  
- `requests` → argument (the package name)

## What “combine into one command” actually means

When people say “combine commands”, they usually mean one of two things:

1. **Multi-part command with subcommands**  
   This is what tools like `pip`, `git`, `docker`, `aws` do.  
   Pattern:

   ```text
   tool subcommand [options] [arguments]
   ```

   Examples:  
   - `pip install requests`  
   - `git commit -m "msg"`  
   - `docker run -p 80:80 nginx`

   Here the “combination” is just: one base program, then subcommand, then flags/args.

2. **Chaining multiple separate commands in the shell**

   This is about the *shell* (PowerShell, cmd, bash, zsh), not Python itself. Common operators:

   - `;` or `&` (depends on shell): run commands one after the other.
     - Bash: `cmd1; cmd2` → run `cmd1`, then `cmd2` no matter what.
     - PowerShell: `cmd1; cmd2` → same idea.
   - `&&`: run the second command **only if the first succeeds**.
     - `pip install requests && python script.py`
   - `||`: run the second command **only if the first fails**.
     - `pip install requests || echo "Install failed"`

   That’s how you “combine” multiple separate commands into a single line.

## How something like `pip install` is implemented

Under the hood, `pip` is just a program that:

- Reads the first argument (`install`, `uninstall`, etc.).  
- Dispatches to the appropriate internal function based on that.  
- Then parses the remaining flags/arguments.

If you wrote your own `mytool` in Python, you could do something like:

```text
mytool convert input.jpg --format png
```

Where:

- `mytool` = your script/exe  
- `convert` = subcommand  
- `input.jpg` = argument  
- `--format png` = option + its value  

The Python side would parse `sys.argv` or use `argparse` / `click` to split those pieces and act accordingly.

## “One command” examples

To make it concrete:

- Single program + subcommand + args:
  - `pip install numpy --upgrade`
- Multiple commands chained:
  - `pip install numpy && pip install pandas`
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt && python main.py`

In both cases it *looks* like “one” console line, but logically:

- First kind = one program with a rich syntax.  
- Second kind = multiple programs glued together with shell operators.

***

If you want next step, say what OS/shell you’re on (Command Prompt, PowerShell, WSL, Git Bash, etc.), and this side chat can walk you through building your own `mytool do-stuff` style CLI in Python, instead of you mashing random flags together like Mr. G opening 37 Chrome tabs to “stay organized.”
