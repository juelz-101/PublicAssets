# PAGE 1 — Introduction to Repository Management

## What is a Git Repository?

A **Git Repository (Repo)** is the core data structure used by Git. It is a folder containing all your project files and a special hidden directory named **`.git`**. This `.git` folder holds all of the project's history, metadata, branch pointers, and configuration—effectively turning your folder into a version-controlled project.

Managing a repository involves establishing this control, recording changes reliably, and synchronizing with remote backups.

## Essential Terminology

| Term | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Working Directory** | Your local file system where you edit files. |
| **Staging Area (Index)** | A holding space to **prepare** a snapshot of changes before they are committed. |
| **Commit** | A permanent, cryptographically secured **snapshot** of the repository at a moment in time. |
| **Remote** | A version of your repository hosted online (e.g., GitHub) for backup and collaboration. |
| **Origin** | The standard default name given to the primary remote repository. |

## The Repository Lifecycle

The basic life of a repository follows a simple cycle:

1.  **Initialize** the repository (`git init` or `git clone`).
2.  **Work** locally (Modify, Stage, Commit).
3.  **Synchronize** with the remote (`git pull` and `git push`).

-----

## Page 2: Setting up a New Repository

Creating a new Git repository from a local folder is a quick process that involves using the **`git init`** command.

Here are the steps to initialize a Git repository in an existing local folder and make your first commit:

## 1\. Initialize the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the root directory of your project (the local folder you want to turn into a Git repo), and run:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/local/folder
git init
```

This command creates a hidden **`.git`** subdirectory inside your project folder. This is where Git stores all the necessary repository metadata and history. Your project is now a local Git repository\!

-----

## 2\. Stage Your Files

Tell Git which files you want to start tracking by staging them for the first commit. To add **all** files in the current directory and its subdirectories:

```bash
git add .
```

If you only want to track specific files, you can use `git add <filename>`.

-----

## 3\. Commit the Changes

Now that your files are staged, you can permanently record a snapshot of them in the repository's history with a commit.

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit of project files"
```

The **`-m`** flag lets you provide a short, descriptive **commit message**. This message should summarize the changes being recorded.

-----

## Next Steps (Optional: Connect to a Remote Repository)

If you want to store your repository on a remote service like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, you'll need to create a repository there and then connect your local repo to it.

1.  **Create a new, empty repository** on your chosen hosting service (do **not** initialize it with a README, license, or `.gitignore` file, as this creates history conflicts).
2.  **Get the remote URL** (usually an HTTPS or SSH link) provided by the hosting service.
3.  **Add the remote** to your local repository:
    ```bash
    git remote add origin <remote_repository_url>
    ```
    *`origin`* is the common conventional name for the primary remote repository.
4.  **Push your local commits** to the remote:
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```
    (Note: The default branch name is commonly **`main`** or **`master`**; use the one that applies to your local setup.) The `-u` flag sets the upstream branch, so future pushes can just be `git push`.

-----

# PAGE 3 — The Local Workflow (Modify, Stage, Commit)

After initialization, all local repository management is centered on the three-state workflow.

## 1\. Checking Repository Status

The `git status` command is the most important tool for local repo management. It tells you the state of your files:

  * **Untracked:** Files that are new and not being monitored by Git.
  * **Modified:** Files that Git is tracking, but which have changes not yet staged.
  * **Staged:** Files whose changes are ready to be included in the next commit.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
git status
```

## 2\. Managing the Staging Area

The Staging Area gives you precise control over what goes into the next commit.

| Command | Action | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `git add <file>` | **Stage** | Moves changes from the Working Directory to the Staging Area. |
| `git add .` | **Stage All** | Stages all modified and new files. |
| `git reset <file>` | **Unstage** | Removes a file's changes from the Staging Area, moving them back to the Working Directory. |
| `git diff` | **Unstaged View** | Shows changes in the Working Directory *not* yet in the Staging Area. |
| `git diff --staged` | **Staged View** | Shows changes in the Staging Area *not* yet committed. |

## 3\. Viewing History

To view the history stored in your repository:

```bash
# Full history (shows author, date, message, and full SHA hash)
git log

# Concise one-line history (great for quick reference)
git log --oneline
```

-----

# PAGE 4 — Managing Remote Connections

Remote management is crucial for synchronization, backup, and collaboration.

## 1\. Cloning an Existing Remote Repository

If a repository already exists on a platform like GitHub, you don't use `git init`; you use `git clone`. This command automatically initializes the local repository, downloads all history, checks out the latest files, and sets the **`origin`** remote connection.

```bash
git clone <remote_repository_url>
```

## 2\. Remote Management Commands

| Command | Direction | Action | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `git remote -v` | N/A | **View Remotes** | Shows the URL(s) your local repo is connected to. |
| `git remote add <name> <url>` | N/A | **Add Remote** | Links a local repository to a remote URL (e.g., `git remote add origin ...`). |
| `git fetch` | Remote → Local | **Download History** | Downloads all new commits, branches, and tags from the remote **without** modifying your local working files. |
| `git pull` | Remote → Local | **Sync and Merge** | A shortcut for `git fetch` followed by `git merge`. Downloads remote changes and integrates them into your current local branch. |
| `git push` | Local → Remote | **Upload Changes** | Uploads your local committed history to the remote repository. |
| `git remote remove <name>` | N/A | **Remove Remote** | Disconnects your local repo from the specified remote. |

# PAGE 5 — Repository Hygiene and Untracked Files

A well-managed repository is clean and only contains necessary source code.

## 1\. The .gitignore File

The **`.gitignore`** file is a plain text file placed in the root of your repository that tells Git which files and directories to **ignore** (i.e., never track, stage, or commit). This is vital for:

  * **Security:** Blocking sensitive files like API keys or environment variables (`.env`).
  * **Cleanliness:** Excluding operating system files (`.DS_Store`) and build artifacts (`/dist`).

### Example .gitignore Directives

```gitignore
# Dependency folders used by package managers
node_modules/
vendor/

# Configuration and Security files
.env
*.local

# Compiled output and logs
/dist/
*.log
*.tmp

# Operating System files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
```

**Important:** If a file is **already committed** and you add it to `.gitignore`, it will still be tracked. To fix this, you must explicitly remove it from the index:

```bash
git rm --cached <filename>
git commit -m "Remove <filename> from tracking"
```

## 2\. Undoing Local Changes

Sometimes you need to completely discard uncommitted changes in your local repo.

| Command | Action | **Danger Level** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `git restore <file>` | **Discard Local Changes** | Low | Undoes uncommitted modifications in the **Working Directory** for a specific file. |
| `git clean -df` | **Delete Untracked Files** | High | Deletes all untracked files and directories. **Use with caution, as files are permanently lost.** |
