# PAGE 1 — Introduction

## What is Git?

**Git** is a free and open-source *distributed version control system (DVCS)* that helps developers manage and track changes in their projects.  
It was created by **Linus Torvalds**, the same developer who created the **Linux kernel**, and is now maintained by the open-source community.

Git is designed to handle **everything from small to massive projects** efficiently, allowing teams (or even a single user) to:
- Record changes made to files over time
- Collaborate with others without overwriting each other’s work
- Restore previous versions when mistakes are made
- Work both **locally** and **remotely**

---

## Why Git Exists

Before Git, version control systems like *CVS* and *Subversion (SVN)* relied on **centralized** servers.  
If the central server went down or you lost connection, development was blocked.  

Git changed that:
- **Every user** has a **complete copy** of the repository.
- Work can continue **offline**, and changes can later be **synced** (pushed or pulled) when connected again.
- This makes Git fast, resilient, and ideal for modern distributed teams.

---

## Git in Practice

Git is commonly paired with online hosting platforms like:
- **GitHub** — the most popular hosting service for open-source and private repositories.
- **GitLab** — includes built-in CI/CD (continuous integration and delivery).
- **Bitbucket** — integrates closely with Jira and Atlassian tools.

These services store remote copies of your Git repositories and make collaboration easier.

---

## Key Benefits

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Distributed** | Every user has a full backup of the entire project. |
| **Fast** | Local commits, branches, and diffs happen instantly. |
| **Secure** | Every commit is cryptographically hashed (SHA-1 or SHA-256). |
| **Flexible** | Supports various workflows (solo, team-based, forked). |

---

### Example Scenario

> **Example:**  
> You’re building an app. You make a few changes that break the project. With Git, you can easily revert to the last working version, compare what went wrong, or branch off to test new ideas — all without losing your main work.

This ability to experiment safely is what makes Git essential to every developer.

---

## Page 2: What is Git?

Git is a version control system that:

* Tracks changes to code over time
* Allows multiple developers to collaborate
* Enables branching, merging, reverting, and restoring code

Used for:

* Software development
* File and document version control
* Project collaboration and history tracking

## Page 3: Key Concepts & Terminology

| Term                  | Description                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Repository (Repo)** | A folder tracked by Git                    |
| **Commit**            | A snapshot of changes                      |
| **Branch**            | A parallel line of development             |
| **Merge**             | Combining branches together                |
| **Clone**             | Copying a remote repo locally              |
| **Push**              | Upload changes to remote                   |
| **Pull**              | Download latest changes from remote        |
| **Staging Area**      | Area where changes are prepared for commit |

---

## Page 4: Installation & Setup

**Install Git:**

* Windows: [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)
* macOS: `brew install git`
* Linux: `sudo apt install git`

**Configure Git:**

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

---

## Page 5: Basic Git Workflow

```bash
git init             # Start a new Git repo
git status           # Check current status
git add .            # Stage changes
git commit -m "Msg"  # Commit changes
git push origin main # Push to remote
```

* Always commit with a message
* Use `git log` to view history
* Pull before pushing when working with others

---

## Page 6: Branching and Merging

```bash
git checkout -b feature-x  # Create + switch to a new branch
git merge feature-x        # Merge into current branch
git branch -d feature-x    # Delete merged branch
```

* Use branches for new features or fixes
* Avoid merging unfinished work

---

## Page 7: Working with GitHub

* Create repo on GitHub first
* Connect local repo:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourname/repo.git
git push -u origin main
```

* Use GitHub Desktop if you prefer GUI

---

## Page 8: Resolving Conflicts

Git will notify you of conflicts during a merge. Resolve them manually:

* Open conflicted file
* Edit sections between `<<<<<<<` and `>>>>>>>`
* Then:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Resolved conflict"
```

---

## Page 9: Useful Git Commands

```bash
git log --oneline       # Short commit history
git diff                # View changes
git reset HEAD~1        # Undo last commit
git stash               # Save changes without committing
git rebase -i HEAD~3    # Interactive rebase
```

---

## Page 10: .gitignore and Clean Repos

`.gitignore` excludes files/folders from being tracked:

```gitignore
node_modules/
*.log
*.tmp
.env
.DS_Store
```

* Keep your repo clean and secure
* Never commit passwords, API keys, or local environment files

---

## Page 11: Tips and Best Practices

* Commit small and often
* Write clear commit messages
* Use branches for each task
* Sync with remote before making big changes
* Always test before pushing

---

## Page 12: Common Mistakes

* Committing to `main` directly
* Forgetting to pull before push
* Committing sensitive data
* Losing track of branches
* Not reviewing `git status` before committing

---

## Page 13: Glossary

| Term     | Meaning                               |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| HEAD     | Current commit pointer                |
| Origin   | Default remote name                   |
| Fork     | A copy of another user’s repo         |
| Upstream | Main/original repo you forked from    |
| Rebase   | Rewriting history to simplify commits |
