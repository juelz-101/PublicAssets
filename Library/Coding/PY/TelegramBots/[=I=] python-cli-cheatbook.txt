# 📘 Introduction

Welcome to the **Python CLI Cheatbook** — a high-clarity resource for getting your hands dirty with the Python command line ecosystem.

Python has become the center of automation, scripting, backend systems, data science, and bots. But unlike the high-level tutorials that flood beginner content, the actual developers and devops teams are relying on command-line tools, flags, virtual environments, packaging systems, and linters to build and maintain real systems.

This book doesn’t try to teach Python — it teaches the tools that *let you ship Python projects*. Every page is designed to be copied, pasted, adapted, and dropped into your own workflows. Each tool is explained just enough to give you control, without wasting your time.

This guide assumes:

* You have Python installed (preferably 3.10+).
* You’re working on Windows, Linux, or WSL (but macOS is fine too).
* You know how to open a terminal, command prompt, or shell.

If you don’t — skip this for now, bookmark it, and come back when you’re ready.

Let’s get to the real stuff.

## Page 01 – `pip` – Python Package Manager

The **`pip`** tool is Python’s de-facto package manager. You use it to install, upgrade, remove, and list Python libraries from the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/).

### 🔹 Basic Commands

```bash
pip install <package-name>
```

Installs a package from PyPI.

```bash
pip uninstall <package-name>
```

Removes the package and all installed modules under it.

```bash
pip list
```

Displays all installed packages in the current environment.

```bash
pip show <package-name>
```

Shows metadata about a package, including version, location, and dependencies.

---

### 🔹 Advanced

```bash
pip install <package-name>==1.2.3
```

Install a specific version of a package.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install all packages listed in a file — used for project dependencies.

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Generate a complete list of currently installed packages and their versions.

---

### 🔹 Example

```bash
pip install requests
```

Installs the `requests` HTTP library.
Now usable in Python:

```python
import requests
requests.get("https://example.com")
```
