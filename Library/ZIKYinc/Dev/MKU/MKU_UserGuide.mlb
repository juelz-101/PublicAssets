<#p.1, "Introduction">

	Introduction
	
	MarkUnder is an advanced text-level Parsing system with many usages and features.

	
<#p.+, "File Types">


	
	Notes: 	1. Until we get a bit further and actually add the markunder symbols, I will just put a (MU) whenever a markunder feature is being explained.
	|>		2. (MU): Something like that to carry a entry to the next line, if its (MU) then all carried lines that follow will be (MU) until (/) or no more lines get carried.
	|>		3. (MU): AutoPaging refers to autoformatting of text-based docs. It will be displayed as a book/magazine/catelog and we will provide many themes to fit all kinds of purposes.
	|>		31 (MU): AutoPaging will auto-gen page numbers, a contents and an index. By default the meta is small-print printed on the lower part of the inside face of the back cover(page before back cover, but can be viewed at anytime via button/trigger/action..
	|>		32 (MU): AutoPaging has different influences on different filetypes and filetags, for instance 'Plans' will have their intro pages manipulated slightly..
---
	(MU): ^ No MarkUnder symbols/callers will conflict with Markdown symbols (hopefully).
	>		For now, when outside of the meta # will be used to indicate its referencing a meta item, * will be used to show ref to another item (@ for external ref), ! will indicate a item thats being referenced (? for external). % indicates that item/content was generated by MarkUnder. (post: I forgot)
	>		There will be settings and toggleboxes to switch between displaying Symbols or showing MarkUnder in full.
</m>		- Meta-tag again to close it.
----------------------------
<#cfg>		- The Config-Tag to access the settings for this file. 
			^ This can also be added anyhere, and each variable can be accessed and changed from anywhere. 
			^ These are mainly for how markunder parses and displays the content and acts as a master settings page.
			^ Just like meta info, config settings have pre-defined options that depend on the file-type. 
			^ This will use data defined in the meta info to calculate what settings should be used.

---

	Preset:			""			-	Save and reuse cfg settings. Empty string means last-used or default if there is no last used for this file type.
	ParsingType		"Full"		-	Master Toggle to override markunder parsing - "Full", "Hide" (Hides all MKU syntax and displays the remaining text), "Off": No processing. Raw Text.
	PageType:		"Book"		-	Initial style to begin display with
	Theme:			"Fresh"		-	A selection of themes that are attached to the page-type.
	ZoomLevel:		100			-	Percentage level of zoom.
	AutoPaging:		"Full"		-	Choose between Off, Partial (block auto-generated pages like Overview or contents) or Full.
	PageSplit:		true		-	Toggle to set pages to be displayed one at a time and display nav-buttons or as a full scrollable page.
	MDConvert:		"Full"		-	If full, MKU will use MD tags for various things, if Ignore then it will parse MD tags as the MD parser would. Off to display the raw tags.
	
	There will be plenty more, but we'll  discuss further when we are adding all of the tags and variables to the app-data.
</cfg>		-	This can be used to end the last opened 
----------------------------
	%(MU): Front Cover (Overview/Landing Page)
	Note: The MKU scripts and data-files refer to this page as the following:
	MainName:					"Overview"
	OtherNames:					["Landing Page", "Auto-Intro"],
	AsVariable:					"cover"
	UID(Unique ID):				"pgen_cover"

	(MU): Firstly most docs will begin intro by referencing data from the meta:
	>		1. FileName - Version
	>		2. Description
	>		3. Author - Org
	>		4. Created - Last Edit
	
			# HTML Modules	 # Version 0.1.0
			# Rolling overal plan for our modules... etc.
			# Juelz-101			# ZIKYinc
			# 05/05/25 22:20	# --/--/--

---
(MU-Plan): Next It will display the title of the current task
	> 		Below it is the short description if it exists
	> 		NOTE: User-Made components (ie: Checkbox with label) can have multiple variations to display (adding one will require a title and nothing else), but aswell as standard non-restricting components, most, if not all component-types will have sister scenario-specific component-types. (All can be accessed anywhere)
	>		The Plan-specific equivilent of the checkbox will, by default, have 4 variations (Title, Short desc, Med desc and full explanation - Title is a clickable link and the others are scrollable, all can be defined from anywhere, and clicking the link takes you to the currently shown descriptions location, or rightclick to show context menu to go to title, click the checkbox to tick it. )
	>		Components can also have multiple links added to different files, locations within files, components, etc and can be navigated to via the right click menu, any set to primary will be included in title.
	>		We will have callers that will allow components to be manipulated from anywhere within the set scope.
	
			Current Task:
	[ ]		Data-Merging - DBManager
			Finish up the db.js by adding the data merging that uses a list of keys and adds them to its master-file if found.

<#p.1,"User-Created Pages">
	%(MU): PG 1 - User-Created Pages
	(MU): Usermade pages can be given a Title, which is displayed with its number at the top of the current page.
		^ As we will explain shortly, many controls can be changed from opening tags.
		
	
	
----------------------------
<#p.2,"Layout">
	%(MU): PG 2 - Layout
	(MU): The layout can be manipulated in many ways, and overrides will be accessible through the cfg tag or page.
	
	A lot of the layout settings will come pre-configured with their page-type and/or theme.
	There will be things like:
		Containers:
			- Standard:			Standard page, 1 container that takes up the entire page and goes from left-right top-bottom.
			- Row: 				Blocks of content that go from left to right.
			- Column:			Blocks of content that are vertical.
			- Grid:				Blocks that are displayed as a grid.
		Margins:
			- Pads:				Padding to set where content should wrap itself and prevent clipping.
			- Splits:			Like pads, but intended to be used between content, and only applied to certain content types.
								^ Example: Throughout this doc, we have used tabspacing between things like names-descriptions..
								^^ 	It makes things easier to read, looks a lot neater and allows more things to be added per line.
								^^ 	Problem is that if a name is longer than a tabspace it messes everything else on that row.
								^^	Splits can be used to ensure nothing gets moved out of place.
								^^	If a name (or whatever) if longer than the space between it and the next item,
								^^	It'll wrap to the next line, and can be set to wrap from the last word, from punctuation,
								^^^		Or from the last character that reached the split (this is also the override if no spaces
								^^^^		Or punctuation within the item.
			- Snaps:			Similar but work as anchors, content can be centred o justified to these.
			These are defined as initial guides to how the page should be displayed, but all can also be controlled dynamically using tags, and displayed as visual guides when controlling them.
			
<#p/>		- Here we manually close the page instead of just opening the next page to close the previous one.
			^	That tag closes current page. 
----------------------------
			
			<+Note:"Content outside of pages, (we'll refer to it as the <@d.void>) are only displayed in a toolbar/sidebar.
				^	This will act as space for dev-notes, calculations, reminders, or whatever else it may be needed for.">
----------------------------	
<#p.3,"Tag Breakdown",[desc:"Is This Overkill?"][cfg]."Book","Old">
	%(MU) PG 3:  - Tag Breakdown
	%(MU) Is This Overkill?					- The combination in the pager-tag has set many things. We will explain.
	
	Ok so that <@d.$tag-config> at the top of page 3 is setting the title, description and theme for the page.
	Although before we can get into that, we need to explain a few things:
	
	When typing the <@d.opener> which is current <-d.opener.tag> (or "<" if I still aint finished this yet), this will 
	^	also engage the search-tool, with a dynamic dropdown menu for suggestions, descrtiptions, tools and examples.
	^	We intend to make this as forgiving as possible.
	^	To achive this we plan to:
		^	1. Give all tags, and predefined variables extra infomation to help with searching (name, desc, keywords, etc).
		^	2. Allow typing of any of the extra info while search is engaged to return the parent item.
		^	3. Have and display colours and icons thats assigned to each variable type, tag type and any other type 
		^	-	or category thats availible.
		^	4. Also include a default value/choice in with the items info.
		^	5. Preview Autofill that uses the default value/option as its placeholder. 
		^	6. This will also apply to the modal that can be used for editing the tag-configs.
		^	7.  There will be more.
		
	Now that thats been explained, lets breakdown what is actually happening in that page-config at the top:
	(Better disable tags for this) </!>
	Lets lay it out, describe what each tag is doing, and stop every now and then to explain where we are at:
	Imagine we have all of the default variables with the type expected loaded from the apps json file, 
	Params are layed out in tags in the same order that they appear in that file, but you can jump to any using navitags.

	B	Breakdown	-	We have: 
	1		<			initiated the MKU tag-system.
	2		#			Said we want to control something.
	3		p			Set the page as our target element for our controller.
	4		.			Opened up the parameters to the page controller.
	x		-		-	
	|	  Notes		-	Defaults:
	|		-			1	-	Each type of Directors have a default action for each element, that it triggers if no action is set
	|		|			1a	-	So the default action for a controller for pages is to toggle on/off.
	|		|			1b	-	The example above doesnt actually set the page to do anything, so it toggles on.
	|		|			1c	-	If no page is set it will either apply it to current page or next page (depending on context/type).
	|		|			1d	-	If no page is set it will either apply it to current page or next page (depending on context/type).
	|		-			-	-	-

	-				-	  -									|	an example of stepping back out. Stepped into [size]
	11	 Value			( 24 )  -	Variable	Setters		-	Set size of title text.

	13	 Key/Val	 ( [key:""] ) -	Navitag		Bouncers	-	Sets the 1st param and returns, (can nest to get anywhere).
	-				-	  -
	14	 Switch	 	  ( true )  -	Variable	Setters		-	Same as before but it also accepts true and false.
	-				-	  -
	15	 Value		  ( "0.5" )  -	Variable	Setters		-	Put as a string to include the decimal. Set to value so 
	-				-	  -									|	check will be done to see if it contains a number.
	15	 Step-Out		( ^ )   -	 -12-		 -12-		-	Step back 1 step. Stepped from title params back to page params

	-	-------			 ------------------------------------------------------
	F	CigBreak	-	Users dont need to: 	
	-		1			Know any of this, as everything can be done with UI 
	-		2		-	Worry about any of this, because why would they. They want the juicy stuff, page titles are not juicy.
	x		-			--
	!	   But		-	This is:
	-		1		-	Crucial foundations being laid to the core of MarkUnder.
	-		2		-	Going to be extended massively, and all going to use this system.
	-		3		-	Vital for communication between AI and System without interfering with the users workflow.
	-		4		-	Key to simpfying integration between so many incompatible tasks, apps and even systems.
	|		-			-	-	-	
	|		!			Besides mentioning that cfg variables can be overriden using the [cfg] tag within the page-config,
	|		:			^	heres just a couple more things to mention :
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	A	  NavPar	  	( () )	  -	 Navitag	Pointers 	-	Navitags and other tags also have params that can be set.
	|				-	  ^	Note:	These will include things like "amount of steps" and "ignore_keys. More details later.
	B	  Home	  		( < )	  -	 Navitag	Bouncers 	-	Bounce back to root, returns to next param after 1st step.	
	|				-	  ^	Note:	The opener then acts as a navitag if in an already opened tag.			
	X	  Closer	  	( > )	  -	 Navitag	Bouncers 	-	Bounce back to root, returns to next param after 1st step.
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Few final notes:
		- 	All tags, keys, parameters, and explanations will be defined within the app-data, which will be loaded using our..
		^		db.js module and our data libraries and dictionaries that can be referenced.
		-	This is still in the planning stage, so is still just placeholder symbolism and examples. Once we get the app-data..
		^		setup and the merging of default data and dictionaries, then
		
----------------------------	
<#p.6,"Bucket Tool">
	%(MU) PG 6:  - Bucket Tool
	
	We will be adding a tool (using electron) to allow for easy parsing. It will display a small toolbar with areas to drag/drop into (or use contect menu) and markunder parser will understand exactly what to do with it using predefined tags and strings. Different areas for different tasks can be setup, pre-configured, toggled and locked as the user pleases. Areas can also clicked to automatically parse whatever is in the clipboard (if set) or even auto-read clipboard (if set).
	Some uses will include:
	- Automatic control of files and documents: Set an area to a folder directory or weblink to automatically copy/move or upload files into the location.
	- Text/component manipulation: Set an area to a file to be able to automatically add to it or control its content in other ways.
	- AI Remote: We will add chatbot character instructions to teach it how to use these tags to allow it to automatically make and edit files and folders as it is assisting you with your projects. The instructions will also explain the markunder filetypes for our project manager and Homelearning tool.
