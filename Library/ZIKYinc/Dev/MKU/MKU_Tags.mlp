	- VARIABLES - - - - 
	* : Any with this symbol means they are required to exist in array and not be empty.
		^ If it doesnt have a * then it can be left empty or removed. Either a default value is set or is considered as "none".
	
	- TAGS:

	If spaces are used within a variable string then it will need to be in "", that way all spaces and tabspaces can be skipped to next variable or closed unless contained in quotation marks. This will also apply to things like ":" (to close label/key and jump to value) and obviously any markunder symbols, although as a user types a string-related symbol/tag in quotation marks, we will still display the search as they do (esc to close, enter to branch down through search or space to continue) and if they do select a result, it will automatically add an end quotation mark and place the tags/callers after it.
	Linked tag details are [CurrentTagPlace, LinkedTagID] - ex: Opener: [1, "closer"] with 1 meaning that opener is first and "closer" being the linked ID.

Mood : Name of parameter

= : Looking for similarities with the last pointed at item (>@ ) do :Target[ to call by name

[1: Energetic,  : Sets to the 1st key in parent array.

Caller: Paranoid, : Simple calling by name

~>6.C : If (~) Greater than (>) 6.C (C= Characters):Grumpy] : Sets param if name > 6 Chars.
