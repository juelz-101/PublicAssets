# Universal Dictionary Building / Document Linking Rules
(Topic-Independent / Viewer & Parser Driven)

---

## Purpose

This document defines how dictionary files and documents are structured, authored, and linked together.

- Documents remain clean, natural, and syntax-free.
- Dictionary files provide structured definitions.
- A custom parser handles all linking at view-time.

This system is designed for human authoring and automated interpretation simultaneously.

---

## Core Design Principles

- Documents contain **no inline syntax**, tags, or markers.
- Dictionaries are the **single source of truth**.
- Linking is generated dynamically while documents are being viewed.
- Dictionaries and documents are authored together but stored separately.

---

## Dictionary File Structure (Example-Based)

Dictionary files use a consistent structure designed for:
- Easy scrolling in raw JSON view
- Fast visual diffing
- Predictable parsing

### Key Structural Notes

- Dictionary files are merged into main dictionary upon load (temp, always kept seperate and merged on load)
- Main dictionary and external files share exactly the same structure and all contents is merged (never overwritten unless its a duplicste item within)
- Certain keys intentionally share the same line for scan-ability.
- Certain keys are omitted entirely if unused 

---

## Skillsets

Skillsets define how `level` and `difficulty` values are interpreted.

### Skillset Registry (`dev_ref`)

- All skillsets used across dictionary files must be registered in:
  `dev_ref.current_skillsets`
- This prevents duplicate skillsets from being created.
- This registry is for development and validation purposes.

---

### Skillset Resolution Order
1. Item-level `s_set`
2. Collection-level `s_set`
3. Dictionary root `s_set`
4. Default skillset (`def`)

### Level & Difficulty Rules
- May be defined as:
  - A string matching the skillset name
  - A number from 1 to 5 (mapped by index)
- Invalid values fall back to the default 


### 2. Skillset Push (`force_to_col_id`)
- Applied at the skillset level
- Forces the skillset onto specific collections
- Acts as a hard override
- Optional
- Omitted entirely if not used

> If neither mechanism is used, the default skillset applies.
> if one mechanic is used, the other may be removed entirely.
> for standard practice we will go skillset -> collection (s_set)
> and we will reserve the other direction for overrides for single items. or resolve mistakes made.


---

## Dictionary Items (Terms)

Each term represents a single definable concept.

Rules:
- Terms are flat objects inside a collection.
- No nesting of terms.
- No item-level skillset assignment unless absolutely required.
- `others` provides aliasing without duplication.

`level` and `difficulty`:
- Use human-readable names
- Mapped through the active skillset
- Numeric values (1–5) may be supported by the parser but are not required

---

## Categories & Subcategories

Categories provide semantic grouping only.

- They do not affect parsing logic.
- They do not affect linking priority.
- They exist for organisation, filtering, and display.

---

## Live Document Parsing & Linking

### Parser Behaviour

- Documents are processed **live while being viewed**.
- The parser scans document text for dictionary terms and aliases.

### When a Match Is Found

- The term is automatically highlighted.
- A clickable link is created.
- Hovering shows a pop-up definition card.
- Clicking may navigate to the full dictionary entry.
