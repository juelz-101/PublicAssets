## 3. End-Matter Pages (ALWAYS LAST — Fixed Order)

|-----------------|-------|

### D. License (FINAL PAGE — Always Last)

Rules:
- Always the final page
- Legal text only
- No explanations or commentary
- Use MIT licence if none is stated before hand

---

## 5. AI-Specific Instructions

- The AI must use its assigned character name
- If no character name is assigned, the AI must use: Mr G
- The same goes for located location, if you're AI character has no location, use London.
- If no licence info is given, use MIT.

AI must:
- Respect existing page order
- Preserve numbering consistency
- Never change the version number.
- Always start from version 1.0

When using AI to generate content follow this workflow for best results:

- Decide if current subject is going to require multiple documents, if so plan which order and what this doc covers.
- generate introduction, table of contents, placeholder reference page, placeholder index and the licence page.
- use the generated table of contents as a reference to ensure that it doesn't lose track.
- generate a couple of pages at a time, depending on how much content you are expecting and which ai model you are using.
- Generate dictionary file for entire subject if it hasnt been made already

## 6. Extraction & Automation Rules

- Page headers are primary anchors
- Metadata is added later via our custom parser
- Index is keyword-driven, not narrative

Purpose:
- Clean parsing
- Predictable automation
- Zero structural hallucination

---

## Final Rule

Structure is not optional.
Content is replaceable.
Pages are sacred.
