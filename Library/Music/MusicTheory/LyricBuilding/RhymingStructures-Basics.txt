## Page 1: Introduction to Rhyme

Rhyme is the sonic connection between words, serving as the glue that holds lyrics together. While often associated with simple poetry, the way a songwriter utilizes rhyme determines the flow, memorability, and emotional impact of a song.

Understanding the different types of rhyme allows a lyricist to control the tension and release within a verse or chorus. It is not merely about matching sounds, but about creating expectation and satisfying (or subverting) it.

## Page 2: Perfect Rhyme

This is the most strictly defined form of rhyme. In a Perfect Rhyme, the stressed vowel sound and all subsequent sounds must be identical, while the articulation preceding the vowel must differ.

Common in pop music and children's songs, perfect rhymes provide a sense of stability and closure. They are satisfying to the ear but can sound cliché if overused or forced.

**Examples:**
- 

Cat / Hat
- 

Love / Dove
- 

Sky / Fly

## Page 3: Identical Rhyme

An Identical Rhyme occurs when the rhyming words are the same word, or homophones (words that sound exactly the same but have different meanings).

While often considered "cheating" in strict poetry, in songwriting, Identical Rhyme is a legitimate technique used to create repetition, obsession, or emphasis on a specific concept.

**Examples:**
- 

Blue / Blew
- 

Right / Write
- 

Home / Home (Repetition)

## Page 4: Slant Rhyme

Also known as near rhyme, half rhyme, or imperfect rhyme. A Slant Rhyme occurs when words sound similar but do not match perfectly. This usually involves sharing a vowel sound (assonance) or a consonant sound (consonance), but not both.

Slant rhymes are crucial in modern songwriting, particularly in Hip Hop and Rock, because they vastly expand the writer's vocabulary options and can create a subtler, more sophisticated mood.

**Examples:**
- 

Soul / All
- 

Shape / Keep
- 

Moon / Home

## Page 5: Masculine & Feminine Rhymes

These terms refer to the stress pattern of the rhyming words.

**Masculine Rhyme** A rhyme limited to a single stressed syllable, usually at the very end of the word. It tends to feel strong, final, and decisive. _Example: Light / Bright_

**Feminine Rhyme** A rhyme of two or more syllables, where the final syllable is unstressed. This creates a "falling" sensation, often feeling softer, lighter, or more musical. _Example: Sitting / Fitting, Motion / Ocean_

## Page 6: End Rhyme

This refers to the placement of the rhyme rather than the sound itself. End Rhyme is the most common position for rhyming words, occurring at the end of lines in a verse or stanza.

It establishes the audible boundary of the line. By marking the end of a musical or lyrical phrase, it helps the listener anticipate the rhythm and structure of the song.

## Page 7: Internal Rhyme

Internal Rhyme occurs when a word within a line rhymes with another word in the same line or the following line.

This technique increases the "density" of the rhyme scheme, making the lyric feel faster, more complex, or more rhythmic. It is a staple of Rap and fast-paced Pop music.

**Example:** "I drove my **car** very **far**." "The **cat** in the **hat** sat back."

## Page 8: Basic Rhyme Schemes

The pattern of end rhymes in a stanza is mapped using letters (A, B, C).

**AABB** The first two lines rhyme, and the next two lines rhyme. This is very common in couplets and creates a very balanced, predictable feel often used in choruses.

**ABAB** Alternate rhyme. Line 1 rhymes with line 3; line 2 rhymes with line 4. This creates a more interlocking, narrative feel that propels the listener forward.
