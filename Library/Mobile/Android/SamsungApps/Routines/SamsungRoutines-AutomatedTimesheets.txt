# Automating Timesheets: Beyond Samsung Routines

Since Samsung Modes and Routines cannot pass "Current Time" data into a calendar event, here are the three best ways to automate your arrival and departure logging.

## Option 1: The "Native" Samsung Workaround (Notification History)

If you don't want to install new apps, you can use the phone's built-in notification log as your timesheet.

**How it works:** You create a routine that simply sends a notification when you arrive. Your phone essentially "keeps the receipt" with the timestamp.
1. 

**Create Routine 1 (Arrival):**
  - 

**If:** Place -> Arrive at [Work]
  - 

**Then:** Notifications -> Show custom notification -> Title: "CLOCKED IN", Text: "You have arrived at work."
1. 

**Create Routine 2 (Departure):**
  - 

**If:** Place -> Leave [Work]
  - 

**Then:** Notifications -> Show custom notification -> Title: "CLOCKED OUT", Text: "You have left work."

**How to get your data:** At the end of the week/month:
1. 

Go to **Settings** > **Notifications** > **Advanced settings**.
1. 

Tap **Notification history**.
1. 

Scroll or search for your "Modes and Routines" notifications. The exact time they fired will be listed there.

## Option 2: IFTTT (Easiest "Set and Forget")

IFTTT (If This Then That) is a third-party service that connects your phone's location directly to Google Sheets or Google Calendar. This is the cleanest solution for timesheets.

**Pros:** completely automatic, creates a spreadsheet for you.
1. 

Download the **IFTTT** app.
1. 

Create an account and connect "Android Device" and "Google Sheets".
1. 

**Create an Applet:**
  - 

**If This:** Android Device -> "Enter a specific area" (Set your work location).
  - 

**Then That:** Google Sheets -> "Add row to spreadsheet".
1. 

**Configure the Row:**
  - 

IFTTT lets you add "Ingredients". You can set the row to automatically write: `{{OccurredAt}} | Arrived at Work`.
1. 

Repeat for "Exit a specific area".

**Result:** You get a Google Sheet named "Work_Times" that automatically populates with timestamps without you touching your phone.

## Option 3: Tasker (The Power User Option)

If you want to stick to a Calendar specifically and want 100% control, **Tasker** is the industry standard for Android automation. It has a steep learning curve but can do exactly what you asked for.

**How it handles your request:**
- 

**Variable Support:** Tasker has a variable called `%TIME`.
- 

**Calendar Insert:** It has an action called "Calendar Insert".
- 

**The Logic:**
  - 

Profile: Location = Work
  - 

Enter Task: Calendar Insert -> Title: "Arrived", Time: `%TIME`
  - 

Exit Task: Calendar Insert -> Title: "Left", Time: `%TIME`

**Cost:** One-time purchase (approx $3.50 / £3.49).
