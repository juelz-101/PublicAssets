# Documentation: Manual JSON Control & Intent Architecture

## 1.0 Introduction: The "Studio Engineer" Mindset

Welcome to the high-level control documentation for Producer.ai. By moving from natural language prompts to **Manual JSON Input**, you are transitioning from being a "listener" to being a "Studio Engineer."

### The Philosophy of "Hard-Coding" Your Sound
Natural language (e.g., "make it sound more grimey") is subjective and prone to AI "hallucinations." When you provide a JSON payload, you are explicitly defining the mathematical boundaries of the generation. You are no longer asking the AI for its opinion; you are giving it a technical specification.

### Why Manual JSON?
1. **Deterministic Control:** Bypass the chat agent's interpretation and send instructions directly to the FUZZ models.
2. **Layering & Masking:** Control exactly *when* sounds start and end using millisecond-precision timestamps.
3. **Weight Precision:** Fine-tune the "Strength" and "Weirdness" parameters beyond the standard presets to find the "Goldilocks Zone" of audio fidelity.

## 2.0 The Core Payload Anatomy
Every manual request is built on a specific JSON structure. Understanding these "Levers" is the first step to mastering the engine.

### The "Sound Prompt" Object
This is the most critical part of your instruction set. Unlike a single text box, you can stack multiple of these.

```json
{
  "text": "The stylistic description",
  "strength": 0.5,
  "time_start": 0.0,
  "time_end": null,
  "vibe": { "audio_input": { "id": "UUID" }, "start_s": 30.0 }
}

```

- `text`: The keywords. Think in textures and instruments, not just genres.

- `strength` (-1.0 to 1.0):

- `1.0`: Absolute dominance.

- `-1.0`: Negative prompting (Active Avoidance). Use this to remove unwanted elements (e.g., "drums" with -1.0 strength).

- `time_start/end`: This is your "Automation Lane." You can have a heavy bass prompt that only exists between 15.0s and 45.0s.

- `vibe`: Your "Texture Sample." This injects the sonic DNA of an existing file into the new generation without copying the notes.

### The "Weirdness" Parameter (0.0 - 1.0)
This controls the Variance.

- Low (0.1 - 0.3): Conservative, structured, "safe" sounds. Best for clean remasters.

- High (0.7 - 0.9): High creativity, natural vocal blends, unexpected transitions. Best for sound design and unique textures.
